        In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation
        developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating
        system known as "NT OS/2". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX
        compatibility
        and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures.
        However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project
        to
        use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a
        similar
        structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but
        also
        supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development
        continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes,
        and
        ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.[31][32]

        Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel. The hybrid kernel was designed as a
        modified microkernel, influenced by the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon
        University,
        but without meeting all of the criteria of a pure microkernel.
        <a href="#top">back to top</a>

    </p>
    <p>

        The first release of the resulting operating system, Windows NT 3.1 (named to associate it with Windows 3.1) was
        released in July 1993, with versions for desktop workstations and servers. Windows NT 3.5 was released in
        September
        1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell's NetWare, and was followed up by Windows NT
        3.51
        in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the PowerPC architecture. Windows NT 4.0 was
        released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of Windows 95 to the NT series. On February 17,
        2000,
        Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0. The Windows NT name was dropped at this point in order
        to
        put a greater focus on the Windows brand.[32]

        Main article: Windows XP
        The next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released on October 25, 2001. The introduction of Windows
        XP
        aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change
        which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors. Windows XP would also
        introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a "task-oriented" Windows Explorer),
        streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport
        services, a "compatibility mode" to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous
        versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality.[33][34]
        <a href="#top">back to top</a>

    <p>

        At retail, Windows XP was marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition was targeted towards consumers,
        while
        the "Professional" edition was targeted towards business environments and power users, and included additional
        security and networking features. Home and Professional were later accompanied by the "Media Center" edition
        (designed for home theater PCs, with an emphasis on support for DVD playback, TV tuner cards, DVR functionality,
        and
        remote controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a
        tablet
        computer, with support for stylus pen input and additional pen-enabled applications).[35][36][37] Mainstream
        support
        for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.[38]

        After Windows 2000, Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems; the server
        counterpart of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, was released in April 2003.[32] It was followed in December
        2005, by
        Windows Server 2003 R2.

        After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and
        January 30, 2007, for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user
        interface
        to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features. It was available in a number of
        different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time,
        criticism
        of new UAC, and stricter license agreement. Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in
        early
        2008.

    Windows 7
    Main article: Windows 7
    On July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing (RTM) and released to the
    public 3 months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of
    new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of
    being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible.[39] Windows 7 has
    multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain
    shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application,[40] a
    home networking system called HomeGroup,[41] and performance improvements.

    Windows 8 and 8.1
    Main articles: Windows 8 and Windows 8.1

    Windows logo (2012–2021)
    Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes
    were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design
    language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the
    Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of
    continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based
    devices. The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels,[42] effectively making it unfit
    for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.

    Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks
    and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software
    distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture, and a new
    keyboard shortcut for screenshots.[43][44][45][46][47][48][49] An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1,[50] was
    released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and
    many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have been subject to some criticism, such as the removal of the
    Start menu.

    Windows 10
    Main article: Windows 10
    On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29,
    2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes on PC include the
    return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the
    desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with
    SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or
    Windows Update (Windows 7).[51]

    In February 2017, Microsoft announced the migration of its Windows source code repository from Perforce to Git. This
    migration involved 3.5 million separate files in a 300-gigabyte repository.[52] By May 2017, 90 percent of its
    engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.[52]

    In June 2021, shortly before Microsoft's announcement of Windows 11, Microsoft updated their lifecycle policy pages
    for Windows 10, revealing that support for their last release of Windows 10 will end on October 14, 2025.[53][54]

    Windows 11
    Main article: Windows 11
    On June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream. The new operating
    system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable. It was released on October 5, 2021.[55][56] As of
    May 2022, Windows 11 is a free upgrade to Windows 10 users who meet the system requirements.[57]

    Windows 365
    See also: Azure Virtual Desktop
    Not to be confused with Microsoft 365.
    In July 2021, Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a
    new Windows 365 service in the following month. It is not a standalone version of Windows, but a web service that
    provides access to Windows 10 and Windows 11 built on top of Azure Virtual Desktop. The new service will allow for
    cross-platform usage, aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users. The
    subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser. The new service is an
    attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend, fostered during the COVID-19 pandemic, for businesses to adopt a
    hybrid remote work environment, in which "employees split their time between the office and home". As the service
    will be accessible through web browsers, Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through
    Google Play or the Apple App Store.[58][59][60][61][62]

    Microsoft announced Windows 365 availability to business and enterprise customers on August 2, 2021.[63]

    Multilingual support
    Multilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3.0. The language for both the keyboard and the
    interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input
    languages, such as Input Method Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and
    earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be
    installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that
    the provided one is insufficient for their needs.

    Interface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain
    editions of Windows. Language Interface Packs (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's
    Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later) – they translate most, but not all, of the
    Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is
    used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translate the complete operating system, are
    only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all
    editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language and are
    commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the
    Download Center, but are available as optional updates through the Windows Update service (except Windows 8).

    The interface language of installed applications is not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. The
    availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.

    Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 introduce a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input
    languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central
    location. The PC Settings app in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 also includes a counterpart settings page
    for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled Windows Store apps (such as
    Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for
    language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except
    Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.

    Platform support
    Windows NT included support for several platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the
    professional world. Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000 (although some
    of the platforms implement 64-bit computing, the OS treated them as 32-bit). Windows 2000 dropped support for all
    platforms, except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of the Windows
    NT family still runs on IA-32 but the Windows Server line ceased supporting this platform with the release of
    Windows Server 2008 R2.

    With the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture (IA-64), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to
    support it. Itanium versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were released at the same time as their
    mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating
    system to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until Windows Server 2012; Windows
    Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.

    On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to
    support x86-64 (or simply x64), the 64-bit version of x86 architecture. Windows Vista was the first client version
    of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.

    An edition of Windows 8 known as Windows RT was specifically created for computers with ARM architecture, and while
    ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting
    from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709) and later includes support for ARM-based PCs.[64]

    Windows 11 is the first version to drop support for 32-bit hardware.[57]

    Windows CE
    Main articles: Windows CE and Windows Phone
    Windows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic
    computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own
    dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers. The OEMs and
    device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the
    technical foundation to do so.

    Windows CE was used in the Dreamcast along with Sega's own proprietary OS for the console. Windows CE was the core
    from which Windows Mobile was derived. Its successor, Windows Phone 7, was based on components from both Windows CE
    6.0 R3 and Windows CE 7.0. Windows Phone 8 however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.

    Windows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with Windows XP Embedded or Windows NT 4.0 Embedded, modular editions
    of Windows based on Windows NT kernel.

    Xbox OS
    Main article: Xbox system software
    Xbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles.[65] From Xbox One onwards
    it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running
    at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment
    for applications.[66] Microsoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox
    Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC.[67] It
    was originally based on NT 6.2 (Windows 8) kernel, and the latest version runs on an NT 10.0 base. This system is
    sometimes referred to as "Windows 10 on Xbox One" or "OneCore".[68][69] Xbox One and Xbox Series operating systems
    also allow limited (due to licensing restrictions and testing resources) backward compatibility with previous
    generation hardware,[70] and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox.[71]

    Version control system
    Up to and including every version before Windows 2000, Microsoft used an in-house version control system named
    Source Library Manager (SLM). Shortly after Windows 2000 was released, Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce
    named Source Depot.[72] This system was used up until 2017 once the system couldn't keep up with the size of
    Windows. Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on
    Source Depot.[citation needed] The Windows code was divided among 65 different repositories with a kind of
    virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code.

    In 2017 Microsoft announced that it would start using Git, an open source version control system created by Linus
    Torvalds and in May 2017 they reported that has completed migration into the Git repository.[73][74][52]

    VFSForGit
    Because of its large, decades-long history, however, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the
    decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage.[citation needed] Each Git
    repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because
    cloning the whole repository takes several hours.[citation needed] Microsoft has been working on a new project
    called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.[74]

    In 2021 the VFS for Git has been superseded by Scalar.[75]
